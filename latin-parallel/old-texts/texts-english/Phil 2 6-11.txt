Though he was in the form of God, † Jesus did not deem equality with God * something To be grasped at.
Rather, he emptied himself † and took the form of a slave, * being born in the Likeness of men.
He was known to be of human estate, * and it was thus that he humbled himself,
Obediently accepting even death, * death on a cross!
Because of this, * God highly exalted him
And bestowed on him the name * above every other name,
So that at Jesus’ name * every knee must bend
In the heavens, on the earth, * and under the earth,
And every tongue proclaim † to the glory of God the Father: * JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit:
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and will be for ever. Amen.
