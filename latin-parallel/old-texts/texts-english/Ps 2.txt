Why this tumult among nations, * among peoples this useless murmuring?
They arise, the kings of the earth, * princes plot against the Lord and his Anointed.
“Come let us break their fetters, * come, let us cast off their yoke.”
He who sits in the heavens laughs; * the Lord is laughing them to scorn.
Then he will speak in his anger, * his rage will strike them with terror.
“It is I who have set up my king * on Zion, my holy mountain.”
I will announce the decree of the Lord: † The Lord said to me: “You are my Son. * It Is I who have begotten you this day.
Ask and I shall bequeath you the nations, * put the ends of the earth in your Possession.
With a rod of iron you will break them, * shatter them like a potter’s jar.”
Now, O kings, understand, * take warning, rulers of the earth;
Serve the Lord with awe * and trembling, pay him your homage
Lest he be angry and you perish; * for suddenly his anger will blaze.
Blessed are they *  Who put their trust in God.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit:
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and will be for ever. Amen.
