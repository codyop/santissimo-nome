How many are my foes, O Lord! * How many are rising up against me!
How many are saying about me: * “There is no help for him in God.”
But you, Lord, are a shield about me, * my glory, who lift up my head.
I cry aloud to the Lord. * He answers from his holy mountain.
I lie down to rest and I sleep. * I wake, for the Lord upholds me.
I will not fear even thousands of people * who are ranged on every side against me.
Arise, Lord; save me, my God, * you who strike all my foes on the mouth,
You who break the teeth of the wicked! * O Lord of salvation, bless your people!
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit:
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and will be for ever. Amen.
