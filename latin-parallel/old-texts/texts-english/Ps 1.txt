Happy indeed is the man * who follows not the counsel of the wicked;
Nor lingers in the way of sinners * nor sits in the company of scorners,
But whose delight is the law of the Lord * and who ponders his law day and night.
He is like a tree that is planted * beside the flowing waters,
That yields its fruit in due season * and whose leaves shall never fade;
And all that he does shall prosper. * Not so are the wicked, not so!
For they like winnowed chaff * shall be driven away by the wind.
When the wicked are judged they shall not stand, * nor find room among those who are Just;
For the Lord guards the way of the just * but the way of the wicked leads to doom.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit:
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and will be for ever. Amen.
