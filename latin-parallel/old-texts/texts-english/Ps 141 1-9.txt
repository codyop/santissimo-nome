I have called to you, Lord; hasten to help me! * Hear my voice when I cry to you.
Let my prayer arise before you like incense, * the raising of my hands like an Evening oblation.
Set, O Lord, a guard over my mouth; * keep watch at the door of my lips!
Do not turn my heart to things that are wrong, * to evil deeds with men who are Sinners.
Never allow me to share in their feasting. * If a good man strikes or reproves me it Is kindness;
But let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head. * Let my prayer be ever against Their malice.
Their princes were thrown down by the side of the rock: * then they understood that My words were kind.
As a millstone is shattered to pieces on the ground, * so their bones were strewn at The mouth of the grave.
To you, Lord God, my eyes are turned: * in you I take refuge; spare my soul!
From the trap they have laid for me keep me safe: * keep me from the snares of those Who do evil.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit:
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and will be for ever. Amen.
