Blessed indeed is the man 
who follows not the counsel of the wicked, 
nor stands in the path with sinners, 
nor abides in the company of scorners, 
but whose delight is the law of the Lord, 
and who ponders his law day and night.
He is like a tree that is planted 
beside the flowing waters, 
that yields its fruit in due season, 
and whose leaves shall never fade; 
and all that he does shall prosper.
Not so are the wicked, not so! 
For they, like winnowed chaff, 
shall be driven away by the wind.
When the wicked are judged they shall not rise, 
nor shall sinners in the council of the righteous; 
for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, 
but the way of the wicked will perish.
